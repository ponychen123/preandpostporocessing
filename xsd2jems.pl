#xsd2jems.pl v1.1, fixed the wrong format of occupancy and Deby factor, 11/28/2018
#xsd2jems.pl v1.0, Author: Chunjin Chen at IMR, cjchen16s@imr.ac.cn
#11/25/2018
#This is a perl script for converting the Materials studio xsd file to the jems crystal file for JEMS.
#Usage: Change the $filename variable to you xsd file, and it will generate a $filename.txt jems file in the JEMS format. you can just export it in txt format.
#Attention: the occupancy and Debyeâ€“Waller factor are reading from xsd file, and photoabsorption coefficient is set to 0.03, you can change it in
#           $absorption value
#this script was modificated from professor Yan Zhao's script sxd2poscar, yan2000@whut.edu.cn
